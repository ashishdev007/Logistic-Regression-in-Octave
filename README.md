##Logistic Regression in Octave
Scripts to find optimal parameters for logistic regression of a discrete data set.

##File Run Down
Utilize advanced optimization functions in Octave to calculate cost function and implement gradient descent for both non-regularized and regularized examples:

1. LogisticRegression.m
2. LogisticRegression_regularized.m

##Usefuls Notes
This is a run through of Programming Exercises 2, taken from the Machine Learning course provided by Coursera.
